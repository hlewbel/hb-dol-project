Google Places API: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search
    - Nearby search: A Nearby Search lets you search for places within a specified area. You can refine your search request by supplying keywords or specifying the type of place you are searching for.
    - Radar Search API: Search up to 200 places at once, area of interest in geographic location
    - Searching: By default, each Nearby Search or Text Search returns up to 20 establishment results per query; however, each search can return as many as 60 results, split across three pages.

Backend: Requests library --> get request --> store those JSONs on disk. In python have a script to output to disk

Cut the csv down so only use that data

To Do List:

8/9 (Leslie):
1. Match DOL data and Google data before seeding database - match on name & exact location
    - Create a function that takes business name and address, checks google API results for exact match. If it exists then add the data to the database
2. Query Google API by zip to get all the businesses with that zip code - then match to ones in the DOL data later? Does this address the 1000 queries/day?
3. Start model.py work

Questions [To Ask]:
1. [Michael]: Is violation data about business HQs or city location?
    trade name location (establishment/branch location not HQs)
2. [Michael]: What about null trade names, official names?
        Hannah error - no null trade names
3. [Michael]: Relevancy, change of ownership, etc
    not updated later - possible ownership has changed
4. [Michael]: What about businesses that change/address the issue? Any that don't?
    No data
5. [Michael]: Severity - how to judge?
    Can make it up: Fair Labor Standards Act cases - look at amt of min wage violation
        (flsa_mw_bw_atp_amt) - making less than min wage $7.25. Divide by # employees
        for amt per person
        or backwages/employee (bw_atp_amt/employee) -- atp is agree to pay
        *** cut out all cases if backwages = 0 AND cmp_assd_cnt (civil monetary penalties)
6. [Teacher]: How do you handle images in a table? URLs?
    - is there a time format for columns?
    - nullable=true means it can be null right? -- yes
    - can number_violations be nullable=True if it has a 0 in that box??
    ---- done
    - When do you specify a relationship? Do I need any?

8/10/2016:
1. Model.py: Add relationships with back references for the tables. - DONE
2. Seed database with seed.py for now using the DOL data and desired columns - TBD

Questions:
1. Teacher
    - backref - orderby?
    - google maps - bonnie mentioned name search
        First get place ID to get name, then do Place Details --> 2 calls
    - order of columns in model file --> order in table right?
2. Michael
    - incomplete zip codes! what's w/ that?? - PR, and leading 0s
    - cut down data to local businesses

8/11/2016
TO DO LIST:
1. Seed file: 
    # Convert DOL data to datetime object when importing into database
    # look at rating's seed.py file
    # look at this line and modify with lower/upper case as applicable:
    # ---> released_at = datetime.datetime.strptime(released_str, "%d-%b-%Y")
    # *** UPDATE THE SEED FILE

Questions:
1. Order of columns in the model file - how about in the seed file? match?

TO DO TOMORROW:
1. check on numeric type and apply that in the model.py for the bw_atp_amt

8/12/2016
1. Debugging tip for strange characters:
    run on command line to see characters: od -c seed.py | less

TO DO:
1. create template page with .html page for displaying the case data
    look at movie_list.html
2. add the google api info to googleapi.py

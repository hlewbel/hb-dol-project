        <h3>Wage Justice App Summary</h3>

        <p>Wage Justice is a Python Flask web app that helps consumers support businesses that simultaneously treat their customers well and adhere to legal wage practices for their employees.<br><br>

        The underlying data is pulled from a PostgreSQL database seeded with cases from the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, and from Google's APIs which provide geocoded locations, business data, and customer reviews. By seeing customer reviews and existing wage violations side-by-side, consumers are able to vote with their wallets. Making violation data publicly accessible applies pressure to the businesses, encouraging them to legally compensate their employees.<br><br>

        This app allows consumers, employees, and businesses to Wage Justice together!<br><br><br>
